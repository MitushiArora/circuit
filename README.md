# circuit


**Description:**
SecureCircuit is a project aimed at implementing and verifying secure circuits using circom, compiling them, generating proofs, deploying them to Ethereum testnets, and verifying the proofs on-chain.

**Instructions:**

1. **Correct Circuit Implementation (circuit.circom):**
Ensure that the circuit implementation (circuit.circom) is correctly written, adhering to the specifications required for your use case. This includes defining the inputs, outputs, and any required logic within the circuit.

2. **Compile the Circuit:**
Compile the circuit using the circom compiler to generate circuit intermediaries. This step is crucial to prepare the circuit for generating proofs.

3. **Generate Proof:**
Once the circuit is compiled, generate a proof using specific inputs. For example, you can generate a proof using inputs A=0 and B=1 to simulate different scenarios and ensure the correctness of the generated proofs.

4. **Deploy Solidity Verifier:**
Deploy a Solidity verifier contract to either the Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet (or any other Ethereum testnet of your choice). The verifier contract will be responsible for verifying the proofs generated by the circuit.

5. **Call verifyProof() Method:**
After deploying the verifier contract, call the verifyProof() method on the contract, providing the generated proof as input. Ensure that the output of this method call is true, indicating that the proof has been successfully verified on-chain.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd SecureCircuit
```

3. Follow the above instructions sequentially to implement, compile, generate proof, deploy verifier contract, and verify the proof on-chain.
